# 3. Case Study with Kepler

Now we will introduce a case study in which we want to create an own workflow.
**Task:**
A file with information about sales is published on the [GitHub Repository](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/PAULUAPAUL/MOSD_Project/master/umsatz.txt). The first column of the text file contains the ArtikelID and the second one contains the sales of the article. We want to know some simple statistical information about the sales (average, minimum, maximum, standard deviation, variance) and plot the sales. To gather statistical information we want to use R. Therefore make sure you already have installed [R](https://cran.r-project.org/bin/windows/base/). The workflow should be documented with Kepler.

How can such a workflow look like? Scratch a workflow and compare it afterwards with a possible solution provided [here](./3_solution_1.md)

Now let's build our workflow with Kepler and see how the data flows.
