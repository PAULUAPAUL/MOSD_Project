# 1.3 Provenance
Data provenance is a description of the origin of the data, so provenance means "origin".
Another definition comes from Herschel et al. [2017] Provenance is the description of the process or a sequence of steps that together with the data and the parameters led to the creation of a data product.
Provenance helps in achieving reproducibility, verification and analysis of results.

If a person who is not directly involved in the project is able to follow all the data throughout its life cycle and understand all the steps used to create outputs, then it is a characteristic of **good provenance**. A good provenance enables analyses to be replicated and results to be reproduced. It is more easy for an outsider to identify potential problems, statistical or logical errors that affect the outcome of a process or study.

Provenance means a greater accountability and implies a more trustworthy science.
