## 1. Documenting Workflows

This chapter will give you a intuitive introduction to workflows and why
they are so important for scientific work. We need a basic knowledge about what
a workflow itself is. Then we will discuss what provenence in terms of workflows mean.
We will conclude this chapter by answering and motivatong the question about
why we should document workflows

# 1.1 Workflow
According to the [Oxford Dictionary](https://www.lexico.com/definition/workflow), a
workflow is "... a sequence of industrial, administrative, or other processes through
which a piece of work passes from initiation to completion."

We learn two things from this brief definition, the first thing is that a workflow
has a starting/ending point. The second insight from the definition is, that we
have multiple stages,steps, processes between the initiation and completion. When we
think of a scientific environment, a workflow can be interpreted as a precise
description of a scientific procedure.
Fair enough, let's look at a example:
