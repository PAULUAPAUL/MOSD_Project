# 1.2 Why documenting workflows?
In the previous chapter we learned what a workflow is and saw how it helps us to document a process. But at this point we can also ask ourselves, why we should document workflows in general.
Well, the answer is pretty simple **reproducibility**.
Reproducibility is at the core of scientific method and a study would lose its credibility if results were not reproducible.
It is often the case that complex processes are used to create final results which is quite difficult to reproduce. That's why a good documentation of the data and the analysis process must be in place to maintain scientific integrity.
The documentation comprises metadata and process metadata. Metadata is data about data and process metadata is data about the process, which is used to create, edit and analyze data.

The main idea is to ensure reproducibility you have to document the process and gather information about analysis, data organization, graphing, etc. which were used to produce outputs. A related concept is **data provenance**. What this term means and how to achieve good provenance can you study in the next chapter.
